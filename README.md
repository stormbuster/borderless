# Borderless NSWindow for SwiftUI

**A small template app that renders a borderless NSWindow (no titlebar) with a fixed aspect ratio for use with SwiftUI. The window is also draggable from anywhere in the window. This is my preferred approach for apps that present rich media (portfolios, presentations, digital magazines). Feel free to use for your own projects.
